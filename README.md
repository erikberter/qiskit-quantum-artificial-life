# qiskit-quantum-artificial-life
Quantum artificial life application using the Qiskit library for Python. In the Jupyter notebook simulation.ipynb you can find 
the code for the different artificial life procedures. We have developed a Quantum Artificial Life library with many functions to 
implement it for various numbers of individual. We can perform the following procedures:
- Creation of an individual.
- Aging (through the interaction of the environment or decoherence)
- Asexual reproduction (clonation)
- Sexual reproduction 
- Mutation
